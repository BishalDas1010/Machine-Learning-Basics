# 📘 Machine Learning Algorithms — Study & Implementation from Scratch

Welcome to this hands-on repository dedicated to learning, implementing, and visualizing various **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** from scratch using Python. Perfect for students, beginners, and aspiring ML engineers who want to understand **how algorithms work internally** — not just use them.

---

## 🎯 Repository Goals

- Understand the **mathematics** behind popular ML algorithms.
- Implement algorithms from **scratch** without using high-level ML libraries.
- **Visualize** results using real-world or synthetic datasets.
- Build strong foundations for **ML interviews**, research, or advanced projects.

## 📚 Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| [Linear Regression](./linear_regression.py) | Supervised | Predict continuous values based on input features. |
| Logistic Regression | Supervised | Classification algorithm for binary outcomes. *(coming soon)* |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Supervised | Instance-based learning for classification/regression. *(coming soon)* |
| Decision Tree | Supervised | Tree-based structure for classification and regression. *(coming soon)* |
| K-Means Clustering | Unsupervised | Partition data into k distinct clusters. *(coming soon)* |
| Naive Bayes | Supervised | Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. *(coming soon)* |
| Principal Component Analysis (PCA) | Unsupervised | Dimensionality reduction technique. *(coming soon)* |

> ✅ More algorithms will be added progressively, including SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting!
